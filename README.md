### Hi, I'm Li!
I'm a Computer Vision Research Scientist, and I enjoy technical writing. Unconventionally, I dropped out of PhD to pursue a research career in the industry instead. So far, I loved it!
* :computer: I developed a continual learning framework for few-shot object detection (coming soon)
* :memo: I wrote [Hands-on Algorithmic Problem Solving](https://github.com/liyin2015/Hands-on-Algorithmic-Problem-Solving), which is open-sourced.
