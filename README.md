### Hi, there! I'm Li! :wave:
I'm a Computer Vision Research Scientist at Meta AI, and I enjoy technical writing. Unconventionally, I dropped out of PhD to pursue a research career in the industry instead. So far, I love it!
* :computer: I developed a continual learning framework for few-shot object detection (coming soon).
* :computer:   I initiated [Awesome Computer Vision Applications](https://github.com/liyin2015/cv-ai-applications) so that you can enjoy learn computer vision tech advances without being overwelemed. 
* :memo: I wrote [Hands-on Algorithmic Problem Solving](https://github.com/liyin2015/Hands-on-Algorithmic-Problem-Solving), which is open-sourced.
* :smirk:Fun fact: I went to coding camp in college, but I "sucked". It was only until my first full-time job as a software engineer, I started to learn ML on my own from Andrew Ng. Now, here I am, doing AI research and writing book on algorithms! It is never too late to do anything! Passion is powerful!
