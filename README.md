### Hi, there! :wave:
I'm an LLM & CV researcher. Unconventionally, I dropped out of PhD to pursue a research career in the industry. My AI journey began with Andrew Ng's online ML class in 2013.
<!---* :computer: I developed a [continual learning framework for few-shot object detection](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sylph-few-shot-detection).--->
* :computer: I developed [AdalFlow](https://github.com/SylphAI-Inc/AdalFlow) - The Library to build and auto-optimize Large Language Model Applications.
  * I wrote its [documentation](https://adalflow.sylph.ai/tutorials/index.html) as if I were writing a book titled "Hands-on LLM Engineering." Yes, I will make it a book.
  * I built its [auto-grad engine](https://adalflow.sylph.ai/use_cases/index.html)(working on papers) as part of advancing research in post-training auto-optimization.
* :memo: I wrote [Hands-on Algorithmic Problem Solving](https://github.com/liyin2015/Hands-on-Algorithmic-Problem-Solving), which is open-sourced.

My theory is: the process of maximizing learning and growth is also the process of maximizing impact and happiness.
