### Hi, there! I'm Li! :wave:
Life for me is not to choose an easy path, but to constantly challenge myself with the unknown. Ex Computer Vision Research Scientist at Meta AI. Unconventionally, I dropped out of PhD to pursue a research career in the industry instead. So far, I love it!
* :computer: I developed a [continual learning framework for few-shot object detection](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sylph-few-shot-detection).
* :memo: I wrote [Hands-on Algorithmic Problem Solving](https://github.com/liyin2015/Hands-on-Algorithmic-Problem-Solving), which is open-sourced.
* :smirk:Fun fact: I went to coding camp in college and sucked at it. It was only until my first full-time job as a software engineer, I started to learn ML on my own from Andrew Ng. That's how my journey in AI started. It is never too late.
